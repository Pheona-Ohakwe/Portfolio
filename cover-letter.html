        <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

        <p>
            I am writing to express my keen interest in the Software Engineer or Junior DevOps Engineer role at your company. 
            With a strong foundation in Python, full stack web development, and DevOps practices, I bring a versatile and solution-oriented mindset to every project I undertake.
        </p>

        <p>
            My experience includes working as a Junior DevOps Engineer at Worldwide Technology, where I contributed to optimizing deployment pipelines and improving cloud infrastructure practices. 
            Previously, at Co.Lab and Coding Temple, I honed my skills in backend and full stack development using frameworks such as Flask, Django, and React. My ability to build RESTful APIs, manage databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL), and create responsive interfaces aligns well with the needs of modern development teams.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have completed several certifications in software engineering and Python through platforms like Co.Lab, Codefinity, and DataQuest, including advanced topics in OOP, data structures, and NumPy/pandas. 
            These have helped me develop not just technical acumen, but also collaborative skills essential for agile teams.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am passionate about building scalable systems, streamlining DevOps workflows, and delivering code that is clean, tested, and maintainable. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my energy, curiosity, and growing expertise to your engineering team.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thank you for your time and consideration. I would be honored to further discuss how my background aligns with your goals. I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you.
        </p>

        <div class="signature">
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
